# Testing Requirements for SciPy

## Introduction

This document outlines the main testing requirements for the Python package SciPy. The goal of the testing is to ensure that the package meets the needs of the users. This entails of testing its performance, reliability and accuracy. This document will walk through the main requirements of SciPy and how these requirements can be tested.

## Software Requirements

The focus of the testing carried out will be the key features of SciPy which are widely used in a range of different circumstances. Some of the most commonly used features of SciPy are the optimisation functions, integration functions, statistical testing, signal processing functions and to compoute linear algebra problems. Functional testing for SciPy will involve verifying the accuracy of these core features across a range of test cases. This could involve inputting complex functions for which there are known solutions and checking that SciPy gives the correct result. Additionally, unit testing will be carried out to verify the correctness and reliability of individual functions. Each unit test will ensure that individual functions perform as expected in isolation, providing a strong foundation for the overall reliability of SciPy.

It is also key that these features produce results in a timely manner for large datasets. This is because users of SciPy do not want to be waiting a long time for the results of their questions. Testing should therefore also include some performance analysis for some SciPy functions with large datasets.

It is also key for users that SciPy can efficiently integrate the output of its functions with the input for other functions, both in SciPy and for other Python packages. Some testing should therefore be done on the integration between SciPy and other prominent Python packages such as NumPy and the integration between separarte SciPy functions.

SciPy meets the needs of its diverse user base. SciPy is widely used by researchers, engineers, and data scientists, so it is essential that the library is intuitive and easy to use. The usability testing will focus on the ease of understanding the documentation, the clarity of function names, and the simplicity of API usage. This involves ensuring that SciPy's key features are accessible with minimal setup and that users can easily find the relevant functions for their tasks. It is also important that error messages are descriptive and helpful, guiding users to understand any issues with their input or function usage. Testing will also examine how useful error messages are when incorrect inputs are put into SciPy's functions and how understandable this would be for someone new to SciPy.

## Testing Methodology

The testing approach will include both automated testing with manual testing, focusing on both the functional correctness and the user experience. Functional testing will verify the accuracy of SciPy's core features across a range of test cases. Each core feature will be tested using known inputs and expected outputs to ensure correctness. This will include optimization functions like scipy.optimize.minimize(), integration functions like scipy.integrate.quad(), statistical testing functions from scipy.stats, signal processing functions such as scipy.signal.convolve(), and linear algebra functions like scipy.linalg.solve(). Test cases will cover typical use cases, as well as edge cases, such as invalid inputs or extreme values, to ensure that SciPy handles them correctly.

Unit testing will be carried out to ensure that individual functions in SciPy are correct and reliable. Each function will be tested independently to verify its behavior under a variety of input conditions, including valid inputs, edge cases, and invalid inputs. For example, unit tests for optimization functions will check that scipy.optimize.minimize() converges correctly for simple test functions while ensuring that appropriate errors are raised for invalid inputs. Unit tests will be automated and designed to provide quick feedback during the development process, helping to identify and fix any issues early on.

Performance testing will evaluate SciPy’s efficiency when handling large datasets and computationally expensive operations. This will involve measuring execution time and memory usage for key functions like optimization, integration, and linear algebra on large datasets, such as thousands of data points or large matrices. The goal is to identify any performance bottlenecks and ensure that SciPy’s functions execute within acceptable time limits, even for large-scale computations. Performance benchmarks will be set, and tests will ensure that SciPy maintains efficiency as dataset sizes grow.

Integration testing will ensure that SciPy functions integrate well with other parts of the Python ecosystem, such as NumPy, Pandas, and other scientific libraries. Key integration tests will include testing functions like scipy.optimize.minimize() that take NumPy arrays as inputs, ensuring smooth interaction with NumPy data structures. Cross-module integration will also be tested to ensure that output from one SciPy function can be used as input to another, such as using the results of scipy.optimize.minimize() as input to scipy.integrate.quad() for further analysis. Testing will also ensure compatibility between SciPy and other Python libraries, verifying that the integration works correctly in real-world data analysis workflows.

Usability testing will ensure that SciPy is easy to use and provides a pleasant experience for users, particularly those who may be new to scientific computing. This will involve evaluating the clarity of SciPy’s function names, the organization and accessibility of its documentation, and the overall simplicity of the API. Documentation will be reviewed for clarity and completeness, ensuring that it is easy for users to find relevant examples and understand how to use the library. Additionally, error messages generated by SciPy when invalid inputs are provided will be tested to ensure they are descriptive, helpful, and guide users in resolving issues. Usability tests will also include feedback from real users to identify any pain points or areas for improvement in the user experience.
